# README

A website made using the [Ruby on Rails](https://rubyonrails.org/) web framework dedicated to hosting an online database supplying information on the sources and artists of anime-style artworks that appear uncredited in popular "Nightcore" videos on YouTube.

I am currently working on finding a way to host the app, so the actual site unfortunately isn't up yet.

## Requirements
* Ruby 3.2.2+
* Rails 7.1.2+
* SQLite3
* [will_paginate](https://github.com/mislav/will_paginate)
* [Ransack](https://github.com/activerecord-hackery/ransack)
