    description: "Imitation Lover is a Japanese eroge visual novel developed by the video game studio light. The character depicted is one of the main love interests, this CG artwork from the game portrays her engaging in her job as a DJ. As of 2023, Imitation Lover has only been released in the Japanese language and no complete translation patches, official or unofficial, are available.<br></br>The Nightcore remix of Dam Dadi Doo was the first track by the Norwegian DJ duo Thomas S. Nilsen and Steffen Ojala Soderholm, who coined the term \"nightcore\" in 2001, to be reuploaded to YouTube. It is therefore often inaccurately referred to as \"the first Nightcore song.\"",

I imagine Shang would occasionally hop over to the Woods to pay Piper a visit and talk about how humans suck and how are you doing and you know, that kind of stuff; like that neighbor you go to when you wanna have a nice philosophical rant about life.\"",
